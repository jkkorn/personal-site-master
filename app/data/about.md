#### Intro
I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil but flew to San Francisco to continue my studies as soon as I left highschool.  I've always been a bit of a nerd, coding my own videogames as a kid and having my personal website at the age of nine.  At university I realized that I wasn't getting excited by code, but instead on the exciting ways that humans and software connected.  I get really excited with datascience, human-computer interactions and engineered dopamine hits.  Today I work at [VTEX](https://www.vtex.com), one of the largest cloud commerce platforms where i'm responsible for development experience. 
<br>
I'm available to consult on interesting projects, particularly education, social impact and health.
